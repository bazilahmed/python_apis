# python_apis

# Program to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator
# To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy),
# the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
# Object is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the weather treads across the globe
